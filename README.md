# No Key: a simple library for Shamir's no-key protocol

Shamirâ€™s no-key protocol is a way to encrypt a communication using finite exponentiation. It is similar to Diffie-Hellman in that it depends on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem, but unlike DH, where both parties agree on a previously unkown datum, the no-key protocol is used to share information (party A transmit some data to party B).
